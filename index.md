Hi, I’m Farhana. I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to improve quality of care and health outcomes, with a long-term goal of advancing precision medicine. 

My expertise includes bioinformatics approaches, such as genetic association studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk score analysis, and Mendelian randomization. I also have experience working with clinical trial and healthcare administrative data. I leverage these tools to investigate the genetic and biological underpinnings of complex traits and treatment responses.

I hold a PhD from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, where my doctoral research in Psychiatric Pharmacogenetics explored the genetic contributions to antidepressant and antipsychotic treatment outcomes, side effects, and pharmacokinetics in individuals with depression and schizophrenia.

Currently, I am conducting research at the Hospital for Sick Children, focused on improving outcomes for hospitalized children and adolescents. I also contribute to teaching data science, bioinformatic, and behavioural genetic courses at the undergraduate and graduate level.

For questions or collaborations, you can reach me by email [farhanaislam@hotmail.com](#). Here is a link to my [CV](#).
