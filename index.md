<br>
Hi, I’m Farhana. I am interested in using data-driven approaches to improve quality of care and health outcomes for patients. I have experience conducting anlalysis on a variety of datasets, including on genomic, epigenmoic, and RNA-seq data, as well as clinical and healthcare adminsitrative datasets.

I have a PhD from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto. My doctoral research, in the field of Psychiatric Pharmacogenetics, investigated the genetic contribution to antidepressant and antipsychotic drug response, side effects, and pharmacokinetics in individuals with depression and schizophrenia. 

Currently, I conduct research at the Hospital for Sick Children focused on improving outcomes for hospitalized children and adolescents.

For questions or collaborations, you can reach me by email [farhanaislam@hotmail.com](#). Here is a link to my [CV](#).
